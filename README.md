# SawftLaunch  
*Go from cold open to sawft launch.*

## Overview  
SawftLaunch is a voice-based icebreaker game built for live dating events such as Cupid Dating. Attendees record a short voice intro that generates fun facts and mystery cards, turning spectators into participants and lowering social barriers.

## Live Demo  
https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/sawftlaunch  

## How It Works  
1. Press Record â€” speak for 5 seconds.  
2. AI (simulated) creates two fun facts from your voice.  
3. A mystery card appears with your QR code.  
4. Spin the wheel to find your match.  
5. Scroll to see a sample connection scene.  

## Tech Stack  
â€“ HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
â€“ Tailwind CSS CDN  
â€“ qrcode.js for QR generation  
â€“ MediaRecorder API for audio  

## Whatâ€™s Real vs Simulated  
âœ… Real: recording, playback, QR display, animations.  
ðŸŒ€ Simulated: AI fact generation, match logic.  

## Purpose  
To demonstrate how SawftLaunch can make Cupid Dating events more interactive, boost audience engagement, and create sponsor-ready moments.

## Future Steps  
â€“ Integrate OpenAI Whisper + GPT for real voiceâ†’fact generation.  
â€“ Add Firebase storage for profiles and matches.  
â€“ Create event dashboard for organizers.  

## Deployment  
```bash
git add .  
git commit -m "Initial POC"  
git push origin main  
# Enable GitHub Pages from main branch (root folder)
```
